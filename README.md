Copyright 2019 Institute of Physics and Technology

This application is designed to visualize data from a scintillator detector.
The data is retrieved from a PostgreSQL database and plotted using Matplotlib.

Key Features:
- Fetches data from a database containing timestamps and particle counts.
- The vector represents the number of registered charged particles in a scintillator.
- Plots the data dynamically with interactive features like zoom and scroll.

This tool is built using PyQt5 for the GUI and Matplotlib for plotting.
It is intended for scientific and educational purposes.
